   abstract = {The mechanisms that control the inflammatory–immune response play a key role in tissue remodelling in cardiovascular diseases. T cell activation receptor CD69 binds to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), inducing the expression of anti-inflammatory NR4A nuclear receptors and modulating inflammation in atherosclerosis. To understand the downstream T cell responses triggered by the CD69-oxLDL binding, we incubated CD69-expressing Jurkat T cells with oxLDL. RNA sequencing revealed a differential gene expression profile dependent on the presence of CD69 and the degree of LDL oxidation. CD69-oxLDL binding induced the expression of NR4A receptors (NR4A1 and NR4A3), but also of PD-1. These results were confirmed using oxLDL and a monoclonal antibody against CD69 in CD69-expressing Jurkat and primary CD4 + lymphocytes. CD69-mediated induction of PD-1 and NR4A3 was dependent on NFAT activation. Silencing NR4A3 slightly increased PD-1 levels, suggesting a potential regulation of PD-1 by this receptor. Moreover, expression of PD-1, CD69 and NR4A3 was increased in human arteries with chronic inflammation compared to healthy controls, with a strong correlation between PD-1 and CD69 mRNA expression (r = 0.655 P < 0.0001). Moreover, PD-1 was expressed in areas enriched in CD3 infiltrating T cells. Our results underscore a novel mechanism of PD-1 induction independent of TCR signalling that might contribute to the role of CD69 in the modulation of inflammation and vascular remodelling in cardiovascular diseases.},

Here, we show that tumor-infiltrating naive CD4+ T cells and Tregs in human breast cancer have overlapping TCR repertoires, while hardly overlap with circulating Tregs, suggesting that intratumoral Tregs mainly develop from naive T cells in situ rather than from recruited Tregs. Furthermore, the abundance of naive CD4+ T cells and Tregs is closely correlated, both indicating poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. Naive CD4+ T cells adhere to tumor slices in proportion to the abundance of CCL18-producing macrophages. Moreover, adoptively transferred human naive CD4+ T cells infiltrate human breast cancer orthotopic xenografts in a CCL18-dependent manner. In human breast cancer xenografts in humanized mice, blocking the recruitment of naive CD4+ T cells into tumor by knocking down the expression of PITPNM3, a CCL18 receptor, significantly reduces intratumoral Tregs and inhibits tumor progression. These findings suggest that breast tumor-infiltrating Tregs arise from chemotaxis of circulating naive CD4+ T cells that differentiate into Tregs in situ. Inhibiting naive CD4+ T cell recruitment into tumors by interfering with PITPNM3 recognition of CCL18 may be an attractive strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.},

T cell exhaustion limits antitumor immunity, but the molecular determinants of this process remain poorly understood. Using a chronic stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to systematically discover regulators of T cell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo Perturb-seq revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally, Arid1a depletion limited the acquisition of exhaustion-associated chromatin accessibility and led to improved antitumor immunity. In summary, we provide an atlas of the genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion and demonstrate that modulation of epigenetic state can improve T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy.},

However, accelerated disease progression, documented as hyperprogressive disease (HPD), was reported in a subset of patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Until now, the mechanisms underlying HPD have not been elucidated. Previous studies have demonstrated that MDM2/MDM4 amplification were associated with HPD. In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between MDM2/MDM4 amplification and HPD. Methods: We reviewed extensive clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in advanced solid tumor patients updated to January 2019, and estimated the incidence of HPD, which was defined as time-to-treatment failure (TTF) < 2 months, and > 50% increase in tumor burden compared with pre-immunotherapy imaging in this study. The proportions of MDM2/MDM4 amplification across different cancer types were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and our own database respectively. Then we plotted the incidence of HPD and the corresponding proportion of MDM2/MDM4 amplification across various cancer types in TCGA. Results: Overall, 19 published clinical trials of 1318 patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were included for analysis, covering 12 types of solid cancers. The incidences of HPD among these studies were ranging from 1.58% in renal clear cell carcinoma to 24.3% in sarcoma. Correspondingly, the proportions of MDM2/MDM4 amplification for these cancer types in TCGA were 0.74% in renal clear cell carcinoma to 20.38% in sarcoma. In our database, in total, 60 patients with MDM2/MDM4 amplification were identified in 2931 patients with the highest proportion of MDM2/MDM4 amplification in sarcoma (22 of 152, 14.5%). A significant correlation was detected between the incidence of HPD and the corresponding proportion of MDM2/MDM4 amplification in TCGA across various cancer types (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.67). Conclusions: Our results suggest that MDM2/MDM4 amplification may be associated with rapid disease progression in patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors among various tumor types. The exact mechanisms underlying HPD are needed to be further evaluated.},

   abstract = {The treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) leads to impressive response rates but primary and secondary resistance to ICI reduces progression-free survival. Novel strategies that interfere with resistance mechanisms are key to further improve patient outcome during ICI therapy. P53 is often inactivated by mouse-double-minute-2 (MDM2), which may decrease immunogenicity of melanoma cells. We analyzed primary patient-derived melanoma cell lines, performed bulk sequencing analysis of patient-derived melanoma samples, and used melanoma mouse models to investigate the role of MDM2-inhibition for enhanced ICI therapy. We found increased expression of IL15 and MHC-II in murine melanoma cells upon p53 induction by MDM2-inhibition. MDM2-inhibitor induced MHC-II and IL15-production, which was p53 dependent as Tp53 knockdown blocked the effect. Lack of IL15-receptor in hematopoietic cells or IL15 neutralization reduced the MDM2-inhibition/p53-induction–mediated antitumor immunity. P53 induction by MDM2-inhibition caused anti-melanoma immune memory as T cells isolated from MDM2-inhibitor–treated melanoma-bearing mice exhibited anti-melanoma activity in secondary melanoma-bearing mice. In patient-derived melanoma cells p53 induction by MDM2-inhibition increased IL15 and MHC-II. IL15 and CIITA expressions were associated with a more favorable prognosis in patients bearing WT but not TP53-mutated melanoma.MDM2-inhibition represents a novel strategy to enhance IL15 and MHC-II–production, which disrupts the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. On the basis of our findings, a clinical trial combining MDM2-inhibition with anti–PD-1 immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma is planned.},

   abstract = {Background
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) induces durable immune responses across a spectrum of advanced cancers and revolutionizes the oncology field. However, only a subset of patients achieves long-lasting clinical benefits. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) usually secrete immunosuppressive cytokines and contribute to the failure of ICB therapy. Therefore, it is crucial to mechanically manipulate the abundance and function of TAMs in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which can offer a promising molecular basis to improve the clinical response efficacy of ICB in cancer patients.
Purpose
This study aims to investigate TAMs in the immunosuppressive microenvironment to identify new therapeutic targets, improve the ability to predict and guide responses to clinical immunotherapy, and develop new strategies for immunotherapy of lung tumors.
Methods
Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) xenograft-bearing mouse models were established to analyze the antitumor activity of Rhizoma Coptidis (RC) in vivo. A systems pharmacology strategy was used to predict the correlation between RC and M2 macrophages. The effect of RC on the abundance of M2 macrophages was analyzed by flow cytometry of murine samples. Western blot was performed to analyze the expression of Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) and LTB4 receptor 1 (BLT1) in harvested lung cancer tissues. The impact of blocking leukotriene B4 (LTB4) signaling by RC on the recruitment of M2 macrophages was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Transwell migration assays were conducted to clarify the inhibition of macrophage migration by blocking LTB4. Lta4h−/− mice were used to investigate the sensitivity of immunotherapy to lung cancer by blocking the LTB4 signaling.
Results
Here, we report that RC, an herbal medicine from the family Ranunculaceae, suppresses the recruitment and immunosuppressive function of TAMs, which in turn sensitizes lung cancer to ICB therapy. Firstly, a systems pharmacology strategy was proposed to identify combinatorial drugs for ICB therapy with a systems biology perspective of drug-target-pathway-TME phenotype. We predicted and verified that RC significantly inhibits tumor growth and the infiltration of M2-TAMs into TME of LLC tumor-bearing mice. Then, RC inhibits the recruitment of macrophages to the tumor TME via blocking LTB4 signaling, and suppresses the expression of immunosuppressive factors (IL-10, TGF-β and VEGF). As a result, RC enables CD8+ T cells to retain their proliferative and infiltrative abilities within the TME. Ultimately, these events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumor cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of anti-PD-L1 therapy. Furthermore, we employed LTA4H deficient mice (Lta4h−/− mice) to evaluate the antitumor efficiency, the results showed that the efficacy of immunotherapy was enhanced due to the synergistic effect of LTB4 signaling blockage and ICB inhibition, leading to remarkable inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma.
Conclusions
Taken together, these findings suggest that RC enhances antitumor immunity, providing a rationale for combining RC with immunotherapies as a potential anti-cancer treatment strategy.},

Vaccination studies in mice and patients have shown that the majority of neoepitopes that elicit T cell responses fail to induce significant antitumor activity, for incompletely understood reasons. We report that radiotherapy upregulates the expression of genes containing immunogenic mutations in a poorly immunogenic mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer. Vaccination with neoepitopes encoded by these genes elicited CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that, whereas ineffective in preventing tumor growth, improved the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy. Mechanistically, neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells preferentially killed irradiated tumor cells. Neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells were required for the therapeutic efficacy of vaccination and acted by producing Th1 cytokines, killing irradiated tumor cells, and promoting epitope spread. Such a cytotoxic activity relied on the ability of radiation to upregulate class II MHC molecules as well as the death receptors FAS/CD95 and DR5 on the surface of tumor cells. These results provide proof-of-principle evidence that radiotherapy works in concert with neoantigen vaccination to improve tumor control.},

   abstract = {Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are essential for maintaining immune tolerance, and the dysfunction of Treg cells may cause autoimmune diseases and tumors. Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is the key transcription factor controlling Treg cell development and suppressive function. Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been identified as an oncoprotein that mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of tumor suppressor p53; however, whether it has functions in Treg cells remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that MDM2 positively regulates human Treg cell suppressive function via its mediated ubiquitination and stabilization of FOXP3. Knockdown of MDM2 with shRNA in human primary Treg cells leads to the impaired ability of FOXP3 to regulate the expression levels of downstream genes and the attenuated suppressive capacity of Treg cells, due to FOXP3 instability. Consistently, MDM2 overexpression in human Treg cells enhances FOXP3 stability and Treg cell suppressive capacity. Mechanistically, MDM2 interacts with FOXP3, and mainly mediates monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of FOXP3, thus stabilizing the protein level of FOXP3. We have also found lysine residues in FOXP3 required for MDM2-mediated ubiquitination. In addition, TCR/CD28 signaling upregulates the expression level of MDM2 and its mediated FOXP3 ubiquitination in human Treg cells. Therefore, our findings reveal that MDM2 in Treg cells could be a potential therapeutic target for treating autoimmune diseases and tumors.},

As reported in previous studies, follistatin-like 3 (FSTL3) could mediate inflammatory response in macrophages by induction lipid accumulation. Herein, we revealed that FSTL3 were overexpressed in malignant cells in the CRC microenvironment, notably, the expression level of FSTL3 was related to tumor immune evasion and the clinical efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy. Further studies determined that hypoxic tumor microenvironment induced the FSTL3 expression via HIF1α in CRC cells, FSTL3 could bind to the transcription factor c-Myc (354–406 amino acids) to suppress the latter’s ubiquitination and increase its stability, thereby to up-regulated the expression of PDL1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). The results in the immunocompetent tumor models verified that FSLT3 knockout in tumor cells increased the proportion of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment, reduced the proportion of regulatory T cells (CD25+ Foxp3+) and exhausted T cells (PD1+ CD8+), and synergistically improved the anti-PD1 therapy efficacy. To sum up, FSTL3 enhanced c-Myc-mediated transcriptional regulation to promote immune evasion and attenuates response to anti-PD1 therapy in CRC, suggesting the potential of FSTL3 as a biomarker of immunotherapeutic efficacy as well as a novel immunotherapeutic target in CRC.},

Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), an inflammatory mediator, has garnered attention for its role in the development of chronic lung diseases and various cancers. Our study highlights the protective role of LTA4H in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence and progression. LTA4H is downregulated in clinical and mouse HCC tumors. LTA4H deficiency exacerbates hepatocyte damage by restraining JNK activation and promotes CD206+ macrophage polarization through the upregulation of LTBP1 expression and downstream transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) secretion and activation. Mechanistically, LTA4H induces heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1) phosphorylation, enhancing their interaction and leading to the functional inhibition of HNRNPA1 in regulating Ltbp1 mRNA maturation and processing in the nucleus. LTA4H-deficient patients exhibit poor prognosis and immunotherapy resistance. Combination therapy targeting TGF-β and PD-1 significantly improves the immunotherapy resistance of LTA4H-knockout Hepa1-6 tumors. Our findings reveal the previously unreported role of LTA4H in regulating the tumor microenvironment and provide insights into potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with LTA4H-deficient HCC.},

   abstract = {The podocan-like protein 1 (PODNL1), an important member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRP) family, is a crucial component of the tumor microenvironment (TME). But its prognostic values and the role in the TME have not been systematically estimated in a pan-cancer setting. Targeting PODNL1, a systematic exploration into the TCGA datasets, reconciling with the analyses of single-cell transcriptomes and immunotherapeutic cohorts in cancers, and validation by tissue microarray-based multiplex immunofluorescence staining was performed. PODNL1 was significantly correlated with the poor prognosis and immunotherapeutic responses in various cancers. In-depth demonstration of molecular mechanisms indicated that PODNL1 expressions were notably positively correlated with cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) infiltration levels in 33 types of cancers. It also positively correlated with the pan-fibroblast TGF-β response signature score, and the hallmarks including TGF-β, TNF-α, inflammatory response, apical junction, epithelial–mesenchymal transition and hedgehog in pan-cancer. Furthermore, high PODNL1 expressions were positively related with the regulation of tumor-promoting TGF-β signaling through downregulating SMAD2/3:4 heterotrimer regulations transcription and up-regulating the pathway restricted SMAD protein phosphorylation. Single-cell transcriptome analyses and immunofluorescence validations indicated that PODNL1 was predominantly expressed in the cancer cells and CAFs in various cancers. Additionally, the heterogeneity of cancer genotype–phenotype cross-talking was also observed associated with PODNL1. Our systematic study indicates that PODNL1 plays an important role in the complex regulation network of tumor progression, and lays a foundation for further exploration to develop PODNL1 as a valuable matrix-mediated biomarker for cancer immunotherapy and prognosis in a pan-cancer setting.},

   abstract = {Abstract Purpose Ferroptosis plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of melanoma. This study developed a robust signature with ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and assessed the ability of this signature to predict OS in patients with skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). Methods RNA-sequencing data and clinical information of melanoma patients were extracted from TCGA, GEO, and GTEx. Univariate, multivariate, and LASSO regression analyses were conducted to identify the gene signature. A 10 FRG signature was an independent and strong predictor of survival. The predictive performance was assessed using ROC curve. The functions of this gene signature were assessed by GO and KEGG analysis. The statuses of low-risk and high-risk groups according to the gene signature were compared by GSEA. In addition, we investigated the possible relationship of FRGs with immunotherapy efficacy. Results A prognostic signature with 10 FRGs (CYBB, IFNG, FBXW7, ARNTL, PROM2, GPX2, JDP2, SLC7A5, TUBE1, and HAMP) was identified by Cox regression analysis. This signature had a higher prediction efficiency than clinicopathological features (AUC = 0.70). The enrichment analyses of DEGs indicated that ferroptosis-related immune pathways were largely enriched. Furthermore, GSEA showed that ferroptosis was associated with immunosuppression in the high-risk group. Finally, immune checkpoints such as PDCD-1 (PD-1), CTLA4, CD274 (PD-L1), and LAG3 were also differential expression in two risk groups. Conclusions The 10 FRGs signature were a strong predictor of OS in SKCM and could be used to predict therapeutic targets for melanoma.},

   abstract = {Transmembrane Channel-like (TMC) genes are critical in the carcinogenesis, proliferation, and cell cycle of human cancers. However, the multi-omics features of TMCs and their role in the prognosis and immunotherapeutic response of human cancer have not been explored. We discovered that TMCs 4-8 were commonly deregulated and correlated with patient survival in a variety of cancers. For example, TMC5 and TMC8 were correlated with the relapse and overall survival rates of breast cancer and skin melanoma, respectively. These results were validated by multiple independent cohorts. TMCs were regulated by DNA methylation and somatic alterations, such as TMC5 amplification in breast cancer (523/1062, 49.2%). Six algorithms concordantly uncovered the critical role of TMCs in the tumor microenvironment, potentially regulating immune cell toxicity and lymphocytes infiltration. Moreover, TMCs 4-8 were correlated with tumor mutation burden and expression of PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA4 in 33 cancers. Thus, we established an immunotherapy response prediction (IRP) score based on the signature of TMCs 4-8. Patients with higher IRP scores showed higher immunotherapeutic responses in five cohorts of skin melanoma (area under curve [AUC] = 0.90 in the training cohort, AUCs range from 0.70 to 0.83 in the validation cohorts). Together, our study highlights the great potential of TMCs as biomarkers for prognosis and immunotherapeutic response, which can pave the way for further investigation of the tumor-infiltrating mechanisms and therapeutic potentials of TMCs in cancer.},

The transition between these states requires important signaling-dependent changes in actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Recently, analysis of actin-regulatory proteins associated with T cell activation has provided new insights into how T cells control actin dynamics in response to external stimuli and how actin facilitates downstream signaling events and effector functions. Among the actin-regulatory proteins that have been identified are nucleation-promoting factors such as WASp, WAVE2, and HS1; severing proteins such as cofilin; motor proteins such as myosin II; and linker proteins such as ezrin and moesin.

   abstract = {Activating T cells reorganize their cortical actin to form a ramified transportation network beneath the immunological synapse. T cell activation and especially trafficking of T cell receptor microclusters during immunological synapse formation are widely thought to rely on cytoskeletal remodeling. However, important details on the involvement of actin in the latter transport processes are missing. Using a suite of advanced optical microscopes to analyze resting and activated T cells, we show that, following contact formation with activating surfaces, these cells sequentially rearrange their cortical actin across the entire cell, creating a previously unreported ramifying actin network above the immunological synapse. This network shows all the characteristics of an inward-growing transportation network and its dynamics correlating with T cell receptor rearrangements. This actin reorganization is accompanied by an increase in the nanoscale actin meshwork size and the dynamic adjustment of the turnover times and filament lengths of two differently sized filamentous actin populations, wherein formin-mediated long actin filaments support a very flat and stiff contact at the immunological synapse interface. The initiation of immunological synapse formation, as highlighted by calcium release, requires markedly little contact with activating surfaces and no cytoskeletal rearrangements. Our work suggests that incipient signaling in T cells initiates global cytoskeletal rearrangements across the whole cell, including a stiffening process for possibly mechanically supporting contact formation at the immunological synapse interface as well as a central ramified transportation network apparently directed at the consolidation of the contact and the delivery of effector functions.},

The main premise for inducing an immune response is the preexistence of antitumor T cells that were limited by specific immune checkpoints. Most patients who have tumor responses maintain long-lasting disease control, yet one-third of patients relapse. Mechanisms of acquired resistance are currently poorly understood, but evidence points to alterations that converge on the antigen presentation and interferon-? signaling pathways.

It is therefore critical to effectively address batch effects in genomic data to overcome these challenges. Many existing methods for batch effects adjustment assume the data follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. However in RNA-seq studies the data are typically skewed, over-dispersed counts, so this assumption is not appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial regression models have been used previously to better capture the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction method, ComBat-seq, using a negative binomial regression model that retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-seq studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common differential expression software packages that require integer counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-seq adjusted data results in better statistical power and control of false positives in differential expression compared to data adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated in a real data example that ComBat-seq successfully removes batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.},

Cell–cell communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and physiological regulation. Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligand–receptor interactions. So cellular communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of signals, and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals. Deciphering intercellular communication networks is critical for understanding cell differentiation, development, and metabolism. First, we comprehensively review the historical milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms of signal molecule transmission and the importance of the main signaling pathways they mediate in maintaining biological functions. Then we systematically introduce a series of human diseases caused by abnormalities in cell communication and their progress in clinical applications. Finally, we summarize various methods for monitoring cell interactions, including cell imaging, proximity-based chemical labeling, mechanical force analysis, downstream analysis strategies, and single-cell technologies. These methods aim to illustrate how biological functions depend on these interactions and the complexity of their regulatory signaling pathways to regulate crucial physiological processes, including tissue homeostasis, cell development, and immune responses in diseases. In addition, this review enhances our understanding of the biological processes that occur after cell–cell binding, highlighting its application in discovering new therapeutic targets and biomarkers related to precision medicine. This collective understanding provides a foundation for developing new targeted drugs and personalized treatments.},

We show that the TC and LE are characterized by unique transcriptional profiles, neighboring cellular compositions, and ligand-receptor interactions. We demonstrate that the gene expression profile associated with the LE is conserved across different cancers while the TC is tissue specific, highlighting common mechanisms underlying tumor progression and invasion. Additionally, we find our LE gene signature is associated with worse clinical outcomes while TC gene signature is associated with improved prognosis across multiple cancer types. Finally, using an in silico modeling approach, we describe spatially-regulated patterns of cell development in OSCC that are predictably associated with drug response.

Currently, ST has been used to profile spatial heterogeneity in multiple cancer types. Besides, ST is a benefit for identifying and comprehensively understanding special spatial areas such as tumor interface and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which exhibit unique tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Therefore, ST has also shown great potential to improve pathological diagnosis and identify novel prognostic factors in cancer.

The tumour stroma is a critical component of the tumour microenvironment, where it has crucial roles in tumour initiation, progression, and metastasis. Most anticancer therapies target cancer cells specifically, but the tumour stroma can promote the resistance of cancer cells to such therapies, eventually resulting in fatal disease. Therefore, novel treatment strategies should combine anticancer and antistromal agents. Herein, we provide an overview of the advances in understanding the complex cancer cell–tumour stroma interactions and discuss how this knowledge can result in more effective therapeutic strategies, which might ultimately improve patient outcomes.},

Here, we report results and demonstrate the applicability of quantitative single-cell spatial proteomics analyses in the TiME of primary and recurrent human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors. Single-cell compositions of a nine patient, primary and recurrent (n = 18), HNSCC cohort is presented, followed by deeper investigation into the spatial architecture of the TiME and its relationship with clinical variables and progression free survival (PFS). Multiple spatial algorithms were used to quantify the spatial landscapes of immune cells within TiMEs and demonstrate that neoplastic tumor-immune cell spatial compartmentalization, rather than mixing, is associated with longer PFS. Mesenchymal (αSMA+) cellular neighborhoods describe distinct immune landscapes associated with neoplastic tumor-immune compartmentalization and improved patient outcomes. Results from this investigation are concordant with studies in other tumor types, suggesting that trends in TiME cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization may be shared across cancers and may provide prognostic value in multiple cancer types.},

We have developed spatial transcriptomics of variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) sequences (Spatial VDJ), a method that maps B cell and T cell receptor sequences in human tissue sections. Spatial VDJ captures lymphocyte clones that match canonical B and T cell distributions and amplifies clonal sequences confirmed by orthogonal methods. We found spatial congruency between paired receptor chains, developed a computational framework to predict receptor pairs, and linked the expansion of distinct B cell clones to different tumor-associated gene expression programs. Spatial VDJ delineates B cell clonal diversity and lineage trajectories within their anatomical niche. Thus, Spatial VDJ captures lymphocyte spatial clonal architecture across tissues, providing a platform to harness clonal sequences for therapy. Although current spatial transcriptomics technologies can locate gene expression within tissues, they are unable to map full-length B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequences in this context. Engblom et al. developed a method called spatial transcriptomics for variable, diversity, and joining sequences (Spatial VDJ), which spatially annotates full-length immunoglobulin and T cell antigen receptor transcripts in frozen human tissue sections. This approach, which also resolves whole transcriptomes and tissue morphology, results in high-fidelity mapping and spatial lineage tracing of B and T cell clones in both human lymphoid and tumor tissues. This technology has the potential to advance our understanding of lymphocyte spatial dynamics in various clinically relevant phenomena such as infection, vaccination, and cancer. ?Seth Thomas Scanlon A spatial transcriptomics?based technology cocaptures B and T cell receptors within their anatomical niches in human tissue.},

We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain.

We present deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq) for co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue slide via next-generation sequencing (NGS). Parallel microfluidic channels were used to deliver DNA barcodes to the surface of a tissue slide, and crossflow of two sets of barcodes, A1-50 and B1-50, followed by ligation in situ, yielded a 2D mosaic of tissue pixels, each containing a unique full barcode AB. Application to mouse embryos revealed major tissue types in early organogenesis as well as fine features like microvasculature in a brain and pigmented epithelium in an eye field. Gene expression profiles in 10-μm pixels conformed into the clusters of single-cell transcriptomes, allowing for rapid identification of cell types and spatial distributions. DBiT-seq can be adopted by researchers with no experience in microfluidics and may find applications in a range of fields including developmental biology, cancer biology, neuroscience, and clinical pathology.},

However, our knowledge of their cellular composition and organization is limited. Here we present a single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics analysis of human breast cancers. We developed a single-cell method of intrinsic subtype classification (SCSubtype) to reveal recurrent neoplastic cell heterogeneity. Immunophenotyping using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) provides high-resolution immune profiles, including new PD-L1/PD-L2+ macrophage populations associated with clinical outcome. Mesenchymal cells displayed diverse functions and cell-surface protein expression through differentiation within three major lineages. Stromal-immune niches were spatially organized in tumors, offering insights into antitumor immune regulation. Using single-cell signatures, we deconvoluted large breast cancer cohorts to stratify them into nine clusters, termed ‘ecotypes’, with unique cellular compositions and clinical outcomes. This study provides a comprehensive transcriptional atlas of the cellular architecture of breast cancer.},

   abstract = {Annotating cell types on the basis of single-cell RNA-seq data is a prerequisite for research on disease progress and tumour microenvironments. Here we show that existing annotation methods typically suffer from a lack of curated marker gene lists, improper handling of batch effects and difficulty in leveraging the latent gene–gene interaction information, impairing their generalization and robustness. We developed a pretrained deep neural network-based model, single-cell bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (scBERT), to overcome the challenges. Following BERT’s approach to pretraining and fine-tuning, scBERT attains a general understanding of gene–gene interactions by being pretrained on huge amounts of unlabelled scRNA-seq data; it is then transferred to the cell type annotation task of unseen and user-specific scRNA-seq data for supervised fine-tuning. Extensive and rigorous benchmark studies validated the superior performance of scBERT on cell type annotation, novel cell type discovery, robustness to batch effects and model interpretability.},

   abstract = {AbstractChemical and genetic perturbations, such as those induced by small molecules and CRISPR, effect complex changes in the molecular states of cells. Despite advances in high-throughput single-cell perturbation screening technology, the space of possible perturbations is far too large to measure exhaustively. Here, we introduce PerturbNet, a flexible deep generative model designed to predict the distribution of cell states induced by unseen chemical or genetic perturbations. PerturbNet accurately predicts gene expression changes in response to unseen small molecules based on their chemical structures while also accounting for key covariates such as dosage and cell type. Moreover, PerturbNet accurately predicts the distribution of single-cell gene expression states following CRISPR activation or CRISPR interference by leveraging gene functional annotations. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, particularly for predicting the effects of perturbing completely unseen genes. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time that amino acid sequence embeddings can be used to predict gene expression changes induced by missense mutations. We use PerturbNet to predict the effects of all point mutations in GATA1 and nominate variants that significantly impact the cell state distribution of human hematopoietic stem cells. Using a crystal structure of GATA1 bound to DNA, we validate that these large-effect variants occur in the core DNA-contact region of GATA1 and tend to involve large changes in amino acid side-chain volume.},

Here, we present scGen (https://github.com/theislab/scgen), a model combining variational autoencoders and latent space vector arithmetics for high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data. We show that scGen accurately models perturbation and infection response of cells across cell types, studies and species. In particular, we demonstrate that scGen learns cell-type and species-specific responses implying that it captures features that distinguish responding from non-responding genes and cells. With the upcoming availability of large-scale atlases of organs in a healthy state, we envision scGen to become a tool for experimental design through in silico screening of perturbation response in the context of disease and drug treatment.},

   abstract = {The stromal compartment of the tumor microenvironment consists of a heterogeneous set of tissue-resident and tumor-infiltrating cells, which are profoundly moulded by cancer cells. An outstanding question is to what extent this heterogeneity is similar between cancers affecting different organs. Here, we profile 233,591 single cells from patients with lung, colorectal, ovary and breast cancer (n = 36) and construct a pan-cancer blueprint of stromal cell heterogeneity using different single-cell RNA and protein-based technologies. We identify 68 stromal cell populations, of which 46 are shared between cancer types and 22 are unique. We also characterise each population phenotypically by highlighting its marker genes, transcription factors, metabolic activities and tissue-specific expression differences. Resident cell types are characterised by substantial tissue specificity, while tumor-infiltrating cell types are largely shared across cancer types. Finally, by applying the blueprint to melanoma tumors treated with checkpoint immunotherapy and identifying a naïve CD4+ T-cell phenotype predictive of response to checkpoint immunotherapy, we illustrate how it can serve as a guide to interpret scRNA-seq data. In conclusion, by providing a comprehensive blueprint through an interactive web server, we generate the first panoramic view on the shared complexity of stromal cells in different cancers.},

Recently, transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural language understanding1,2 and computer vision3 by leveraging deep learning models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-tuned towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited task-specific data. Here, we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30 million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic targets.},

   abstract = {Large deep learning models offer significant accuracy gains, but training billions to trillions of parameters is challenging. Existing solutions such as data and model parallelisms exhibit fundamental limitations to fit these models into limited device memory, while obtaining computation, communication and development efficiency. We develop a novel solution, Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), to optimize memory, vastly improving training speed while increasing the model size that can be efficiently trained. ZeRO eliminates memory redundancies in data- and model-parallel training while retaining low communication volume and high computational granularity, allowing us to scale the model size proportional to the number of devices with sustained high efficiency. Our analysis on memory requirements and communication volume demonstrates: ZeRO has the potential to scale beyond 1 Trillion parameters using today's hardware. We implement and evaluate ZeRO: it trains large models of over 100B parameter with super-linear speedup on 400 GPUs, achieving throughput of 15 Petaflops. This represents an 8x increase in model size and 10x increase in achievable performance over state-of-the-art. In terms of usability, ZeRO can train large models of up to 13B parameters (e.g., larger than Megatron GPT 8.3B and T5 11B) without requiring model parallelism which is harder for scientists to apply. Last but not the least, researchers have used the system breakthroughs of ZeRO to create the world's largest language model (Turing-NLG, 17B parameters) with record breaking accuracy.},

   abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

   abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

   abstract = {Explore new techniques in Microsoft's open source library called DeepSpeed, which advances large model training by improving scale, speed, cost, and usability, unlocking the ability to train 100-billion-parameter models. DeepSpeed is compatible with PyTorch. One piece of our library, called ZeRO, is a new parallelized optimizer that greatly reduces the resources needed for model and data parallelism while massively increasing the number of parameters that can be trained. Researchers have used these breakthroughs to create Turing Natural Language Generation (Turing-NLG), which at the time of its release was the largest publicly known language model at 17 billion parameters. In addition we will also go over our latest transformer kernel advancements that led the DeepSpeed team to achieve the world fastest BERT pretraining record.The Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) is a novel memory optimization technology for large-scale distributed deep learning. ZeRO can train deep learning models with over 100 billion parameters on the current generation of GPU clusters at three to five times the throughput of the current best system. It also presents a clear path to training models with trillions of parameters, demonstrating an unprecedented leap in deep learning system technology.DeepSpeed brings state-of-the-art training techniques, such as ZeRO, optimized kernels, distributed training, mixed precision, and checkpointing, through lightweight APIs compatible with PyTorch. With just a few lines of code changes to your PyTorch model, you can leverage DeepSpeed to address underlying performance challenges and boost the speed and scale of your training.},

   abstract = {One of the pressing open problems of computational systems biology is the elucidation of the topology of genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) using high throughput genomic data, in particular microarray gene expression data. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

   abstract = {Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a fundamental challenge in biology that aims to unravel the complex relationships between genes and their regulators. Deciphering these networks plays a critical role in understanding the underlying regulatory crosstalk that drives many cellular processes and diseases. Recent advances in sequencing technology have led to the development of state-of-the-art GRN inference methods that exploit matched single-cell multi-omic data. By employing diverse mathematical and statistical methodologies, these methods aim to reconstruct more comprehensive and precise gene regulatory networks. In this review, we give a brief overview on the statistical and methodological foundations commonly used in GRN inference methods. We then compare and contrast the latest state-of-the-art GRN inference methods for single-cell matched multi-omics data, and discuss their assumptions, limitations and opportunities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions that hold promise for further advancements in this rapidly developing field.},

   abstract = {Regulatory network reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computational biology. There are significant limitations to such reconstruction using individual datasets, and increasingly people attempt to construct networks using multiple, independent datasets obtained from complementary sources, but methods for this integration are lacking. We developed PANDA (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation), a message-passing model using multiple sources of information to predict regulatory relationships, and used it to integrate protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and sequence motif data to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks in yeast as a model. The resulting networks were not only more accurate than those produced using individual data sets and other existing methods, but they also captured information regarding specific biological mechanisms and pathways that were missed using other methodologies. PANDA is scalable to higher eukaryotes, applicable to specific tissue or cell type data and conceptually generalizable to include a variety of regulatory, interaction, expression, and other genome-scale data. An implementation of the PANDA algorithm is available at www.sourceforge.net/projects/panda-net.},
